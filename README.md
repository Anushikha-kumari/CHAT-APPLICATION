DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED:

This is a real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO for seamless, bidirectional communication between users. The app allows multiple users to join chat rooms, send and receive messages instantly, and see real-time notifications when users connect or disconnect. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is fully responsive, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. Communication is handled via WebSockets using Socket.IO, ensuring low-latency, real-time data transfer between client and server. This project demonstrates full-stack integration, event-based architecture, and modern web communication techniques.
